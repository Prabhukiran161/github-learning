# ðŸš€ GitHub Learning Journey

Welcome to my **GitHub Learning Journey** repository!  
This project is a personal log of everything I learn about **GitHub commands, workflows, and best practices** â€” structured day by day.  

I believe the **fastest and smoothest way to learn GitHub** is by practicing **CLI commands** rather than relying only on the GitHub Desktop or GUI.  
Most real-world scenarios (like deploying projects on cloud servers) involve only the **terminal**, so being comfortable with commands is a must.  

This repo is designed not only to help me learn and keep track of my progress but also to serve as a **clear reference** for anyone else who wants to learn GitHub step by step.
