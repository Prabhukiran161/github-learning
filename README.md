# üöÄ GitHub Learning Journey

- üìí This project is my **personal log** of learning GitHub step by step.
- üõ†Ô∏è Focus is on **GitHub CLI commands**, not just the GUI.
- ‚ö° CLI is **faster, smoother, and practical** for real-world workflows.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Most cloud servers only allow **terminal access**, so CLI skills are essential.
- üìö The repo is structured **day by day** with one new topic/command each day.
- üîó Main README links to **detailed files** with examples, explanations, and variations.
