# 🚀 GitHub Learning Journey

- 📒 This project is my **personal log** of learning GitHub step by step.
- 🛠️ Focus is on **GitHub CLI commands**, not just the GUI.
- ⚡ CLI is **faster, smoother, and practical** for real-world workflows.
- ☁️ Most cloud servers only allow **terminal access**, so CLI skills are essential.
- 📚 The repo is structured **day by day** with one new topic/command each day.
- 🔗 Main README links to **detailed files** with examples, explanations, and variations.
